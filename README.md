# Replicate Simulations from Ashlagi, I., Kanoria, Y. and Leshno, J. (2017)

This repository store the code and results of replicate the simulations made by Itai Ashlagi, Yash Kanoria and Jacob D. Leshno in their paper ["Unbalanced Random Matching Markets: The Stark Effect of Competition"](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/689869) (2017). It is motivated by a presentation that I had to make in the elective course "Market Design", corresponding to the second year of the Master in Economics at the University of Chile. Is assumed that the reader is familiarized with the paper and topics of a Marriage Market.  

In the files you can find:  
- RandomSerialDictatorship.R: An R Script that contains a function I created in order to implement the Random Serial Dictatorship Algorithm.  
- ReplicationsFigs1To3.R    : An R Script that simulates the observations necessary to replicate Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the paper.  
- ReplicationsFigs4And5.R   : An R Script that simulates the observations necessary to replicate Figures 4 and 5 of the paper.  
- ReplicationsTabs1To3.R    : An R Script that simulates the observations necessary to replicate Tables 1, 2 and 3 of the paper.  
- Presentation1_print.pdf   : A PDF of the presentation (in spanish) made for the course.  
- Presentation2_print.pdf   : A PDF of the presentation (in spanish) made for the course.  

Probably you will not be able to replicate the same exact results from the presentation because a seed wasn't set. In a future I want to replicate the rest of results and extent them to other cases or mechanisms.
