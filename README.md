# Replication Simulations Ashlagi, I., Kanoria, Y. and Leshno, J. (2017)

This repository store the code and results of replicate the simulations made by Itai Ashlagi, Yash Kanoria and Jacob D. Leshno in their paper "Unbalanced Random Matching Markets: The Stark Effect of Competition" (2017). It is motivated by a presentation that I had to make in the elective course "Market Design", corresponding to the second year of the Master in Economics at the University of Chile. In a future I hope to extent the results in other cases.
